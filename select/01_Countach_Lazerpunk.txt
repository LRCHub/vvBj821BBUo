Watch it

The Lamborghini Countach is the absolute best of retrowave sportscars
Due to its powerful engine and unique design
It quickly became one of the most iconic cars of the 1980's
The Countach is the perfect combination of power and style
Reaching 100 kilometers per hour in just 5 seconds
With a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour
The Countach is a savage opponent on the racetrack
And the undesputed king of the streets
The Lamborghini Countach
